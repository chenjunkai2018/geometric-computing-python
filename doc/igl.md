**Libigl** is a simple python and C++ geometry processing library. We have a wide functionality including construction of sparse discrete differential geometry operators and finite-elements matrices such as the cotangent Laplacian and diagonalized mass matrix, and simple facet and edge-based topology data structures.

It can be easily install trough conda:
```bash
conda install igl
```
